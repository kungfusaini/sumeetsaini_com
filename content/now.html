<h3>November 2025</h3>

<h4>Focus</h4>

<p>
Over the last month, I focused on creating my personal website from scratch, and hosting this website, along with a custom API on my newly acquired VPS.
</p>

<p>
I decided to deploy with Docker containers, so I leared how these work, and set up a robust deployment pipeline with github actions.

If you want to check out my project "aether" take a look on
