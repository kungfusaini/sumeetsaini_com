<h4>Focus</h4>

<p>
The start of the year has been busy, with a lot of exploration and experimentation.
</p>

<p>
I recently started freelance web development, and completed my first client project. It's a change of pace from the AI red teaming I have been working on. I learned a lot about the more professional aspects of client work, like consent managment, CMS platforms and how to handle payments and billing. It was a legnthy project that took a good chunk of the month, but I a very proud with the result. I hope to work on more web projects along side my AI work in the future, so reach out if you need some work done!
</p>

<p>
I have also been experimenting a lot with my AI workflow.

has been by tool of choice, but I was not seeing the results I wanted using it raw with even models as powerful as Claude Opus 4.5. I had heard about

	Oh My Opencode
</a>
and wanted to give it a shot, but wanted to tailor the agent and LLM pairings to be hyper specialised.

is a great service I found that has a very generous subscription model that allowed me to experiment a lot, and I now have a system I am very happy with. I will be writing a post on my blog

soon detailing my findings.

Speaking of my blog, I'm getting more and more readers every month! Even though my goal was never to gain an audience, I am very happy to see people checking it out, so if you have, thanks! If you haven't, check it out

<p>
I've made some tweaks to the finance system I created last month and it has really been helping me manage the In's and Out's of freelancing with confidence. Finally, I have been sitting on an idea for quite heavily modifying my guitar with full MIDI support for a while. I have been tinkering with my Raspbery Pi, and hopefully I'll have something I can share and take on stage pretty soon!
</p>

<p>
This month I will continue working on my AI red teaming work, and furthering my learning in AI and AI agents.
