<h4>Focus</h4>

<p>
This month, I built my blog 
<a href="arcanecodex.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
  <img src="/assets/link_icons/arcanecodex.svg" alt="Arcane Codex" class="link-icon"> 
	Arcane Codex
</a>
using the 
<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

</a>
framework. A lot of the time was spent in theming, so I learned a lot about effective use of CSS. Deployment was relatively easy due to having already built infrastructure on my VPS. The most recent posts will be featured on this website in the blog panel.

Aside from freelancing, I spent the rest of the month partaking in Google's 5 day intensive AI agents course. I have a good grasp on the framework now, building the foundation for future projects to come. You can check out my

This month I will be focusing on contracting, writing on my blog and experimenting with AI agents.
