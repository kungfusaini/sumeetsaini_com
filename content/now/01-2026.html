<h4>Focus</h4>

<p>
Happy New Year!
</p>

<p>
Recently, I mostly focused on my freelance AI red teaming work, but still had some time to do some other cool stuff!

Freelancing has been a crash course in the "business" side of things—contracts, pricing, and packaging services. I am in the middle of creating a client focused brand, Reliq, which will serve as a hub for my freelance work and new web dev projects, for which I learned a lot about SEO, client hosting and CMS.

Thankfully, the hosting infrastructure I built months ago has made launching these new sites and email accounts incredibly fast.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to see how my websites were performing, so I integrated analytics, via
<a href="https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
Plausible
</a>
. It's been great to see exactly where people are finding my stuff and how they interact with my pages.
I've noticed increased traffic to this site but especially my blog.
Speaking of my blog, I created a few new posts on
<a href="https://arcanecodex.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
  <img src="/assets/link_icons/arcanecodex.svg" alt="Arcane Codex" class="link-icon"> 
	Arcane Codex
</a>
, and was especially proud of the one exploring the missing skills of vibecoders! 

I'm glad people are seeing what I am putting out into the world!

For other random stuff, of course my system config
<a href="https://github.com/kungfusaini/dotfiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
  <img src="/assets/link_icons/github.svg" alt="GitHub" class="link-icon"> 
	system config
</a>
gets better by the day, but I also found out about 
<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
	TaskWarrior
</a>
which filled a really massive need for managing my tasks effectively from the terminal. 
</p>


<p>
I also built a simple tool  and API for capturing thoughts rapidly, which I called 
<a href="https://github.com/kungfusaini/bucket" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
  <img src="/assets/link_icons/github.svg" alt="GitHub" class="link-icon"> 
	bucket
</a>
and a telegram bot 
<a href="https://github.com/kungfusaini/bucketbot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
  <img src="/assets/link_icons/github.svg" alt="GitHub" class="link-icon"> 
	bucketbot
</a>
so I can have the same functionality from my phone too. It works great for me and helps me follow the 
<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
	GTD philosophy.
</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, I started work on a new finance dashboard because I got tired of using Excel and remembered I can do everything in python instead (wink!). The 
<a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 
	streamlit
</a>
framework is amazing, handling all the front end, and I can just focus on data manipulation!
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I'm forgetting a few things but it's been a great month! This month I will be building client websites, my own professional brand, and finishing up some of the projects mentioned above! Thanks for stopping by.
